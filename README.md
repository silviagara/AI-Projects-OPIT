## ðŸš€ About Me

Hi! I'm Silvia â€” a former communication specialist turned aspiring AI developer. Iâ€™m currently wrapping up my Master's in Applied Data Science & AI at OPIT, where Iâ€™ve been diving deep into NLP, LLMs, and all things language + logic.

With a background in linguistics and intercultural communication, I bring a people-first perspective to tech. I love building things that make language more accessible, insightful, or just a little more human. Right now, I'm exploring projects that blend large language models with real-world use cases â€” from sentiment analysis to agentic AI.

This repo is where I share my hands-on learning journey. Stick around â€” more to come! âœ¨
