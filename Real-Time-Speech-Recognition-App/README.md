# Real-Time Speech Recognition App with Gradio

This project was developed as part of the "Natural Language Processing / Audio Processing" course of my Master's in Applied Data Science and AI.

It implements an interactive web application for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) that records audio directly from the browser and transcribes it in real-time using transformer-based models.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Gradio (Web UI framework)
- Hugging Face Transformers
- PyTorch
- Whisper ASR model
- Google Colab

## Project Overview

The application provides a user-friendly interface where users can:
- Record audio directly through their browser microphone
- Automatically transcribe the recorded speech to text
- View transcription results in real-time

The assignment required building an ASR application using Gradio. I implemented a solution leveraging OpenAI's Whisper model for high-accuracy speech recognition with GPU acceleration support.

## How to Use

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab (recommended for GPU access).
2. Run all cells sequentially.
3. Once Gradio launches, the interface will display with:
   - A microphone input button
   - An output text box for transcriptions
4. Click the microphone icon, grant browser permissions, and start speaking.
5. The app will automatically transcribe your speech.

## How to Reproduce the Results

- Ensure GPU is available in Colab for optimal performance.
- Run all cells as is.
- The Gradio interface will launch with a public link for testing.
- **Note:** GPU memory is cleared at initialization to avoid memory issues during extended use.

## Technical Highlights

- **Model:** Whisper (OpenAI's robust multilingual ASR model)
- **Framework:** Gradio for rapid prototyping of ML interfaces
- **Optimization:** GPU acceleration with memory management
- **Deployment:** Shareable web interface with public URL

## Notes

- The app is optimized for GPU environments (Google Colab recommended).
- Supports multiple languages depending on the Whisper model variant used.
- Real-time transcription provides immediate feedback for testing and demos.
- This project demonstrates how to quickly transform ML models into interactive, user-facing applications.
